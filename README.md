I developed this project as simple and understandable as possible. I added more than one URLSession fetching style (Combine, Async Await). I added both UI and UT tests. There might be a lot of thing to do. After, reviewing my project, I would like you to discuss it with me in more detail. I believe there are always better design. So, I am looking forward to hear from you and have a great conversation with you.
